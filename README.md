When the app loads the first question you will see is whether you are playing in a familiar or non-familiar group. Then, you proceed to finding out if there are any alcohol-free persons. Afterwards, you are faced with the interface of the gamemode, where you choose which gamemodes you will play. Among these, you may choose to play all, some of them, or even just one. The game begins after the selection.
