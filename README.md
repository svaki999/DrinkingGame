The first question you will see when the app loads is whether you are playing in a familiar or non-familiar group. Then, it goes on to the part where you need to find out if there are any alcohol-free persons. After that, you are faced with the interface of the gamemode, where you choose which gamemodes you will play. Among these, you may choose to play all the gamemodes, some of them, or even just one. This done, the game begins.
