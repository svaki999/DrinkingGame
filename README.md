## DRUKSPIL: SIP OR SPILL / SLURK ELLER SPILD

Introducing a customizable drinking game mode that promises fun, inclusivity, and safety for all participants. Whether you're in the mood for alcohol-free fun or responsible drinking, our game adjusts to your group's preferences.

The app loads up with two buttons: create game and join game. When creating a game the first question is to answer whether the host is playing with a familiar or a non-familiar group. The host creates a game and gets a game code for the rest of the players to join the game. When the players are joining the lobby with other players, they are to first state their name and then decide if they feel like drinking. The host gets the gamemodes interface where the host chooses which gamemodes the group wants to play. Between these, the host can choose to play all or some of them or even just a single gamemode. The host also chooses of how many rounds they will play. The game starts after the selection.
