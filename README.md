## DRUKSPIL: SIP OR SPILL / SLURK ELLER SPILD

Introducing a customizable drinking game mode that promises fun, inclusivity, and safety for all participants. Whether you're in the mood for alcohol-free fun or responsible drinking, our game adjusts to your group's preferences.

**Options:**
- **Familiar Group / Non-Familiar Group:** Tailor the game's content based on how well the participants know each other.
- **Alcohol / Alcohol-Free:** Choose your preferred mode to ensure everyone can join in the fun.

**Game Modes:**
- Questions
- Truth or Dare
- Category
- Racegame
- Memory game
- Tic Tac Toe 1v1s

**Point System:**
- The person with the highest points at the end of each round becomes the king/queen, gaining the power to add or remove a rule to the game. Points are updated after each round.

**Custom Rounds**
- Players have the option to select the number of rounds they wish to participate in.

**Fairness**
- For a non-alcoholic player, the game is nerfed. Example with the memory game: the leaving of the cards from the screen would be much faster than the one played by the alcoholic player.

**DIY Drink Recipes (Non-Alcoholic & Alcoholic):**
- The person with the lowest points has to drink a DIY Drink. Everyone else contributes a single ingredient/type of liquid (liquor, soda, milk, hot sauce, etc.) to the concoction.

**Familiar Group Ideas:**
- For those who know each other well, indulge in more intimate questions to deepen your connections.

**Non-Familiar Group Ideas:**
- Perfect for getting to know new friends or colleagues, with a variety of engaging and fun prompts to break the ice.

The app loads up with two buttons: create game and join game. The first question to answer is whether the user is playing with a familiar or a non-familiar group. The host creates a game and gets a game code for the rest of the players to join the game. When the players are joining the lobby with other players, they are to first state their name and then decide if they feel like drinking. The host gets the gamemodes interface where the host chooses which gamemodes the group wants to play. Between these, the host can choose to play all or some of them or even just a single gamemode. The host also chooses of how many rounds they will play. The game starts after the selection.
